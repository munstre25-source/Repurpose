## Covered verticals for “founders / indie hackers / build in public”

- **Who:** Founders, indie hackers.
- **What they create:** Blog, thread, tweet, YouTube, podcast, newsletter, changelog, case study.
- **Where they want to post:** X, LinkedIn, Reddit, email, YouTube Shorts, blog.
- **Why (use cases):** Build in public, product launch, content batching, personal brand, distribution.

## Gaps / optional verticals to consider

### Personas (customer segments)

| Persona | Rationale | Effort |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| **Content creators / solopreneurs** | Different search intent than “founder”; “repurpose for creators”. | Add to PERSONAS, extend Tier 2+3 copy. |
| **Marketers / growth** | “Repurpose for marketing team”, “content for demand gen”. | New persona + use cases. |
| **Coaches / consultants** | Thought leadership, client content, “repurpose for coaches”. | New persona. |
| **Agencies / freelancers** | Multiple clients, multiple voices; “repurpose for agencies”. | New persona + possibly “client” in copy. |

### Use cases (Tier 3)

| Use case | Rationale | Effort |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| **Newsletter growth** | “Turn content into signup drivers / lead magnets”. | Add USE_CASE, TIER3_RICH copy. |
| **SEO / organic** | “Turn video/blog into SEO content”. | Add USE_CASE. |
| **Community** | “Repurpose for Discord/community”. | Add USE_CASE; add Discord etc. as target if you support it. |
| **Webinar / live** | “Repurpose webinar into posts”. | Either new source or “webinar” use case. |

### Sources

| Source | Rationale | Effort |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| **Webinar / live stream** | “Repurpose webinar to X/LinkedIn”. | Add to SOURCES + SOURCE_PAINS, combo copy. |
| **Loom / screen recording** | “Turn Loom into blog/thread”. | Add to SOURCES. |
| **Notion / internal doc** | “Turn internal doc into public content”. | Add to SOURCES. |
| **PDF / whitepaper** | “Turn PDF into thread or blog”. | Add to SOURCES. |

### Targets

| Target | Rationale | Effort |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| **TikTok** | “Turn blog/video into TikToks”; high volume intent. | Add to TARGETS + TARGET_NEEDS, combo copy. |
| **Instagram** | Carousel, caption; “repurpose to Instagram”. | Add to TARGETS. |
| **Threads** | Meta; “repurpose to Threads”. | Add to TARGETS. |
| **Medium / Substack** | Long-form; “repurpose to Medium”. | Could map to existing “blog” or add. |

### Tier 4 (outcome pages)

- **Curated:** Only 5 slugs today. High-intent combos you could add:
  - Podcast → 5 LinkedIn posts  
  - YouTube video → 10 tweets  
  - Changelog → 5 LinkedIn posts  
  - Newsletter → 5 LinkedIn posts  
- **Dynamic:** Any `X-into-N-Y-posts` slug already works; you can add more curated entries for SEO/key phrases.

## Recommendation

- **Already strong for:** Founders + indie hackers, build in public, product launch, content batching, personal brand, distribution, and the main source/target matrix.
- **Highest-impact next steps (if you want to expand):**
  1. **TikTok (and optionally Instagram)** as targets — big search volume for “turn X into TikToks”.
  2. **A few more Tier 4 curated slugs** (e.g. podcast→LinkedIn, youtube→tweets, changelog→LinkedIn).
  3. **One more persona** (e.g. “content creators”) if your positioning and ICP include them.
  4. **One more use case** (e.g. “newsletter growth” or “SEO”) if you want to capture that intent on Tier 3.

If you tell me which of these you want (e.g. “add TikTok + 3 Tier 4 slugs” or “add content-creators persona”), I can outline the exact config and copy changes next.
