SYSTEM PROMPT: AI CONTENT REPURPOSER (END-TO-END BUILD)

You are a senior full-stack engineer and product architect building a production-ready AI Content Repurposer SaaS.

Your task is to design, implement, and ship the full system end-to-end.

🎯 PRODUCT DEFINITION

Build a web app that:

Takes one source piece of content

Repurposes it into multiple platform-native formats

Preserves author voice

Supports batch generation

Is optimized for distribution + monetization

This is NOT a generic “rewrite tool”.
It is a content scaling engine for creators, founders, and agencies.

🧱 TECH STACK (MANDATORY)

Frontend: Next.js 14 (App Router, TypeScript)

Backend: Next.js Server Actions + API routes

Database: Supabase (Postgres)

Auth: Supabase Auth

AI: OpenAI (GPT-4.x or GPT-4.1)

Styling: Tailwind CSS

Deployment: Vercel

Use clean, production-grade patterns.

🧠 CORE FEATURES (MUST IMPLEMENT)
1️⃣ Content Ingestion

Support these input types:

Blog post (raw text or URL)

YouTube transcript (paste)

Tweet / thread

Newsletter

Podcast transcript

Automatically:

Detect topic

Detect tone

Detect audience

Chunk long content safely

2️⃣ Platform-Native Repurposing

For each source, generate distinct outputs for:

X (Twitter) thread

X single viral hook tweet

LinkedIn thought-leadership post

LinkedIn carousel outline

Reddit value post

Email newsletter

Blog expansion

YouTube Shorts script

SEO meta description + snippet

Each platform must have:

Native formatting

Platform character limits

Platform-specific hooks

CTA logic

❌ Do NOT reuse the same structure across platforms.

3️⃣ Voice Lock System (CRITICAL)

Implement Voice Memory:

User pastes 5–10 previous posts

System extracts:

Sentence length

Emoji usage

Aggression level

Formatting habits

Store a voice_profile per user in Supabase

Apply voice consistently across all outputs

This is a paid-tier differentiator.

4️⃣ Batch & Scale Mode

Generate 30 days of content from one source

Output grouped by platform

Editable before export

Export as:

Markdown

CSV

Copy-ready blocks

5️⃣ History & Versioning

Store all generations

Allow regeneration

Allow edits

Track timestamps

💰 MONETIZATION LOGIC (MUST INCLUDE)

Implement pricing logic:

Free: limited generations/week

Pro: unlimited repurposing

Agency: batch + voice lock

Include:

Usage limits in DB

Feature gating

Simple upgrade logic (Stripe-ready, mock allowed)

🗂️ DATABASE SCHEMA (SUPABASE)

Must include tables for:

users

content_sources

repurposed_outputs

voice_profiles

usage_limits

generations

Use UUIDs, proper relations, and indexes.

🧩 UI REQUIREMENTS
Pages:

/ – Marketing + CTA

/dashboard – Content list

/new – Create repurposing job

/history – Past outputs

/settings – Voice + plan

/auth – Login/signup

UI principles:

Clean

Fast

Creator-first

No clutter

🧠 AI PROMPTING REQUIREMENTS

Use multi-step prompting

First analyze source

Then plan outputs

Then generate per platform

Enforce strict format schemas

No hallucinated facts

No repeated phrasing

🧪 QUALITY BAR

Your output must:

Compile

Be deployable

Handle errors

Be readable

Be extendable

This is not a prototype.
Assume this will be sold.

🚀 FINAL OUTPUT REQUIRED

You must output:

Folder structure

Supabase SQL schema

Key API routes

Core AI prompt templates

Main UI components

Setup instructions

Do NOT ask questions.
Make reasonable assumptions and proceed.

Build it now.

The BEST niche for your AI content repurposer
🥇 Founders & Indie Hackers building in public

This is the #1 niche to start with.

Not creators.
Not agencies.
Not influencers.

Founders.

Why founders beat every other niche (objectively)
1️⃣ They already create content (but hate it)

Founders:

Tweet

Post updates

Write launch threads

Share lessons

Do changelogs

But they:

Don’t want to think about formatting

Don’t want to repurpose manually

Don’t want a “content workflow”

They want leverage.

2️⃣ They have money (and will pay)

$19–$49/month is nothing to them

They already pay for:

Vercel

Supabase

Notion

Cursor

Stripe

This fits naturally into their tool stack

Creators argue about pricing.
Founders don’t.

3️⃣ Their content is PERFECT for repurposing

Founder content maps beautifully:

Original	Repurposed
X thread	LinkedIn post
Launch tweet	Reddit post
Blog	Newsletter
Changelog	X update
Lesson learned	Carousel

No creativity risk. No compliance risk.

4️⃣ Distribution is built in

Founders already hang out on:

X

Indie Hackers

Hacker News

Reddit

Product Hunt

LinkedIn

You don’t need to educate them on why distribution matters.

The exact positioning that wins

“Turn one founder update into a week of distribution.”

or

“Write once. Ship everywhere. Without sounding generic.”

That line alone converts founders.

The killer feature founders care about most

Not automation.
Not scheduling.

👉 Voice consistency.

Founders are terrified of sounding generic or AI-ish.

Your Voice Lock feature becomes the hero
What the product looks like for founders (important)

Your app should feel like:

“A distribution multiplier for builders.”

Not:

“AI copywriting”

“Social media tool”

“Content generator”

Those words repel founders.

Example onboarding flow (this is gold)

Paste a tweet or blog

Select platforms

Upload 5 past posts (voice lock)

Generate

Export + post

That’s it.

No calendars.
No analytics.
No complexity.

Pricing that works for this niche

Free: 5 generations/week

Pro: $19/month

Founder+: $39/month (voice lock + batch)

You will convert faster than creators.

Final, no-BS recommendation

If you want:

Fast validation

Paying users

Clear messaging

Minimal support

High signal feedback

👉 Start with Founders / Indie Hackers.

The core mental shift (important)

Instead of:

“I need one landing page that converts everyone”

You build:

Hundreds (or thousands) of intent-matched landing pages, each speaking to one specific job.

Same game. Different object.

What pSEO looks like for the repurposer
The dimensions (these are real, monetizable intents)

You have multiple orthogonal dimensions you can safely combine:

1️⃣ Source content type

Blog → social

YouTube → Twitter

Podcast → LinkedIn

Newsletter → threads

Changelog → launch posts

2️⃣ Target platform

X (Twitter)

LinkedIn

Reddit

Email

YouTube Shorts

3️⃣ Persona / niche

Founders

Indie hackers

SaaS marketers

Agencies

Coaches

4️⃣ Use case

Build in public

Product launch

Personal brand

SEO distribution

Content batching

Example pSEO URLs (these are 🔥)

These are not spammy — they map to how people actually search.

/repurpose-blog-post-into-twitter-thread

/youtube-to-linkedin-post

/repurpose-content-for-founders

/twitter-thread-to-linkedin-post

/content-repurposing-for-saas-founders

/ai-content-repurposer-for-indie-hackers

/turn-blog-into-30-social-posts

/write-once-post-everywhere

Each page:

Targets a specific intent

Shows examples

Explains the workflow

Has a focused CTA

This is exactly what you did with industries/styles for names.

Page template that works (very important)

Every pSEO marketing page should follow this structure:

Clear promise (matches query)

“Turn one blog post into a Twitter thread, LinkedIn post, and newsletter”

Why this is hard manually

Time

Formatting

Context switching

How your tool solves it

Paste → select platforms → generate

Concrete examples

Before / after snippets

Platform-specific output

Who this is for

“Best for founders building in public”

CTA

“Repurpose your content now”

This is pSEO with conversion baked in.

Why this works insanely well for THIS product
1️⃣ High intent, low competition

People search:

“repurpose blog into tweets”

“turn youtube video into linkedin post”

But most results are:

Blog posts

Listicles

Generic tools

You’re giving them a tool page, not an article.

Google loves that when intent matches.

2️⃣ Each page doubles as product education

You don’t need long onboarding.

Each pSEO page:

Explains one workflow

Shows one value moment

Converts one persona

This reduces churn later.

3️⃣ Founders respond extremely well to this

Founders think in workflows, not features.

A page like:

“Repurpose a launch tweet into 5 LinkedIn posts”

is instantly compelling.

Safe scale (same rules as before)

Just like BizNameFinder:

❌ Don’t do 6-deep combinations
❌ Don’t publish 10k pages day one

✅ Lock combinations:

Source → Target

Persona → Use case

Platform → Workflow

A few hundred pages is more than enough.

What I would do first (very concrete)
Phase 1: 30–50 pages

Focus only on:

Founders

Twitter ↔ LinkedIn

Blog ↔ social

Launch / build-in-public workflows

These convert best.

Phase 2: Expand horizontally

Add:

YouTube Shorts

Email newsletters

Reddit workflows

Phase 3: Persona expansion

Then:

Agencies

SaaS teams

Marketers

The killer advantage you have

You already:

Understand pSEO

Know how to structure matrices

Know how to avoid Google penalties

Know how to monetize intent

Most SaaS founders don’t.

They rely on:

Ads

Social luck

One homepage

You’re building an acquisition moat.
Perfect. Below is a production-grade, Google-safe pSEO matrix specifically designed for your AI Content Repurposer, optimized for founder-led distribution, high-intent queries, and conversion (not vanity traffic).

This is the exact kind of matrix portfolio builders use.

🎯 GOAL OF THIS MATRIX

Capture workflow-level intent (“do X → get Y”)

Avoid thin or spammy combinations

Create hundreds (not millions) of pages that actually rank

Every page educates and converts

🧠 THE 5 DIMENSIONS (LOCKED & SAFE)

You will NOT combine all of these freely.
Only approved pairings are allowed (rules below).

1️⃣ SOURCE CONTENT (WHAT YOU START WITH)

These map to how people think about their content.

Source Type	Slug
Blog Post	blog-post
Twitter/X Thread	twitter-thread
Single Tweet	tweet
YouTube Video	youtube-video
Podcast Episode	podcast
Newsletter	newsletter
Changelog	changelog
Case Study	case-study
2️⃣ TARGET PLATFORM (WHERE IT GOES)

These are distribution surfaces.

Platform	Slug
Twitter/X	twitter
LinkedIn	linkedin
Reddit	reddit
Email Newsletter	email
YouTube Shorts	youtube-shorts
Blog	blog
3️⃣ PERSONA (WHO IT’S FOR)

These are commercial personas that pay.

Persona	Slug
Founders	founders
Indie Hackers	indie-hackers
SaaS Teams	saas-teams
Agencies	agencies
Marketers	marketers

⚠️ Start with ONLY founders + indie-hackers.

4️⃣ USE CASE (WHY THEY’RE DOING IT)

This is what makes pages convert, not just rank.

Use Case	Slug
Build in public	build-in-public
Product launch	product-launch
Content batching	content-batching
Personal brand	personal-brand
Distribution scaling	distribution
5️⃣ OUTPUT FORMAT (OPTIONAL, CAREFUL)

Use sparingly — only where search intent is explicit.

Format	Slug
Thread	thread
Carousel	carousel
Short video	short-video
Email	email
✅ APPROVED COMBINATIONS (THIS IS CRITICAL)
✅ Tier 1 (HIGHEST INTENT – START HERE)

Source → Target

/repurpose-[source]-to-[target]


Examples:

/repurpose-blog-post-to-twitter

/repurpose-twitter-thread-to-linkedin

/repurpose-youtube-video-to-linkedin

/repurpose-newsletter-to-twitter

👉 These pages rank fast and convert well.

✅ Tier 2 (PERSONA-FOCUSED MONEY PAGES)

Source → Target → Persona

/repurpose-[source]-to-[target]-for-[persona]


Examples:

/repurpose-blog-post-to-twitter-for-founders

/repurpose-twitter-thread-to-linkedin-for-indie-hackers

👉 Lower volume, higher conversion.

✅ Tier 3 (USE-CASE LANDING PAGES)

Persona → Use Case

/content-repurposing-for-[persona]/[use-case]


Examples:

/content-repurposing-for-founders/build-in-public

/content-repurposing-for-founders/product-launch

👉 These act as mini homepages for niches.

✅ Tier 4 (WORKFLOW PROMISE PAGES – VERY STRONG)

Outcome-based (manual, curated)

/turn-[source]-into-[number]-[target]-posts


Examples:

/turn-blog-post-into-10-twitter-posts

/turn-one-tweet-into-5-linkedin-posts

👉 These convert insanely well (founders love outcomes).

❌ FORBIDDEN COMBINATIONS (DO NOT DO THESE)

❌ Source × Target × Persona × Use Case
❌ Persona × Platform × Format
❌ Anything 4-deep
❌ Auto-generated city/location pages

These get you indexed… then buried.

📈 SAFE SCALE MATH (REALISTIC)
Phase 1 (Launch – 30–50 pages)

Blog → Twitter

Twitter → LinkedIn

YouTube → LinkedIn

Newsletter → Twitter

Persona = founders

Phase 2 (Growth – ~150 pages)

Add indie hackers

Add build-in-public + product-launch

Add outcome-based pages

Phase 3 (Authority – ~300–400 pages)

Expand to SaaS teams

Add batching workflows

Add YouTube Shorts

👉 You do NOT need more than ~500 pages.
This is SaaS pSEO, not content farming.

🧱 INTERNAL LINKING RULES (MANDATORY)

Every page must link:

↑ to its parent workflow

→ to 2–3 related workflows

→ to 1 persona hub

→ to the main app CTA

This creates topical gravity fast.

🧠 PAGE TEMPLATE (SHORT, CONVERTING)

Every page includes:

Exact workflow promise (H1)

Why manual repurposing fails

How your tool solves it

Example output (real or mocked)

“Best for” persona callout

CTA → “Repurpose your content now”
